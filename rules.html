    <h1>RULES OF BLACKJACK</h1>
    <p>The goal of blackjack is to beat the Dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
    ______________________________
    <ol>Terms to know</ol>
        <li>ANTE - the inital bet that starts the game.</li>
        <li>BET - adding money based on </li>
        <li>BLACKJACK - the best possible hand; an ACE and another card with a value of 10.</li>
        <li>BLUFFING - lying about your quality of cards.</li>
        <li>BUST - going over 21; is an automatic loss.</li>
        <li>DEALER - the person that hands out the cards, accepts bets, and overall runs the game.</li>
        <li>FOLD - removing yourself from the current hand.</li>
        <li>HAND - a kind of "round" in the game, starts when the first 2 cards are dealt and ends when you WIN or LOSE.</li>
        <li>HIT - asking for another card.</li>
        <li>STAY/STAND - keeping the cards you have and not asking for more.</li>
        <li>POT - the total amount of bets and antes.</li>
     ______________________________
    <p>Traditionally the Dealer goes counter clock-wise starting on the first Player on the left and ending with the Dealer. This is for all aspects of the game.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the round, before the cards are dealt, each Player, turns in an *ANTE*, this is a small bet that shows the Dealer who all is playing this game.</p>
    <p>Each Player is dealt 2 cards, 1 face-up and 1 face-down. The Dealer is dealt 2 cards, both face-up.</p>
    <p>After the Dealer and Player(s) have been dealt their starting cards, and they have been given a chance to view their hand, the Player(s) can either **BET** or **FOLD**. The Dealer is not given these options.</p>
    <p>After the opening round and each Player, starting with the one on the left of the Dealer, is asked if they would like to **HIT**, or **STAY**.</p>
    <p>The Player's turn is over when they **HIT**, and get as many cards desired without going **BUST**.</p>
    <p>All **ANTEs** and **BETs** are put into the **POT**. At the end of the **HAND** the closest to 21, without going **BUST**, gets the whole **POT**.</p>
    <p>If at the end of the **HAND** two or more Players hold the same amount, the **POT** is split evenly among them.</p>
